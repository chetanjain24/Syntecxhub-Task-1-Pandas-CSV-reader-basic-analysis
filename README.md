📊 Project 2: Pandas CSV Reader & Basic Data Analysis
# 📌 Overview:

This project demonstrates fundamental data handling and exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills using Python and Pandas. The objective is to read structured data from CSV/Excel files, perform basic inspection, compute summary statistics, filter data, and export processed results.

This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship, focusing on real-world data manipulation workflows commonly used by data analysts and data scientists.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used:

1. Python
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Google colab
5. CSV / Excel Files

# 📂 Project Features

✔ Read CSV/Excel files into a Pandas DataFrame
✔ Inspect dataset using head(), tail(), info(), and dtypes
✔ Compute summary statistics:

1. Mean
2. Median
3. Minimum
4. Maximum
5. Count

✔ Filter rows based on conditions
✔ Select specific columns and slice subsets
✔ Export cleaned and filtered data back to CSV/Excel
